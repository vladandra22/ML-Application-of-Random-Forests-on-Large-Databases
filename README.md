# ML Application of Random Forests on Large Databases

The project involved applying Random Forest algorithms to analyze two distinct databases: one containing diabetes data and the other comprising credit scores. The main challenge was to effectively balance accuracy and computational efficiency across both datasets. Additionally, selecting appropriate features and tuning the model parameters were critical steps in optimizing performance and ensuring robust, reliable predictions for both medical and financial data.
